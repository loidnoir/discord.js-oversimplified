Our command handler is a file-based system for creating commands. This approach streamlines the process of adding new commands, making it more easy, efficient and organized.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { Client } from 'discord.js-oversimplified'
import path from 'path'

const client = new Client()
const commandPath = path.join(__dirname, '/commands')

client.enableCommands(commandPath)
client.login("...")
```
